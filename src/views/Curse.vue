              <li>In the 1985 Japan Championship Series, underdog Hanshin Tigers of Kansai beat the Yomiuri Giants of Tokyo, widely considered the Kings of Japanese Baseball.</li>
              <li>Hanshin fans erupted in celebration at Ebisu Bridge in Osaka, where fans celerbrated by jumping in the river when a player's name was shouted out.</li>
              <li>Randy Bass did not have a fan that resembled him so fans seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders from the nearby KFC and threw it into the river.</li>
              <li>After 1985, the Hanshin Tigers endured a 16-year losing streak, often placing in the bottom two positions in their league.</li>
              <li>On March 10, 2009 while dredging the river, divers uncovered the remains of the Colonel Sanders statue. It was missing its left hand and glasses.</li>
              <li>The curse can only be lifted when the left hand and glasses of the original statue are returned to KFC.</li>
